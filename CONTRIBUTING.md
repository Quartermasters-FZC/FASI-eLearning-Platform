## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual functions/components
   - Fast execution (< 1s per test)
   - No external dependencies
   - 95%+ coverage requirement

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test service interactions
   - Database and API integration
   - Moderate execution time (< 30s)

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Real browser automation
   - Slower execution (< 5min)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test:unit              # All unit tests
npm run test:unit:watch        # Watch mode
npm run test:unit:coverage     # With coverage

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration       # All integration tests

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e              # Full E2E suite
npm run test:e2e:headed       # With browser UI

# AI services tests
cd ai-services/speech-recognition
pytest tests/unit/ -v --cov=src
pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

### Test Requirements

- **Coverage**: Maintain 95%+ test coverage
- **Performance**: Unit tests must complete in < 1s
- **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on external services
- **Documentation**: Complex test scenarios need comments

## üìö Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

1. **Python** - Use Google-style docstrings:
```python
def translate_text(text: str, source_lang: str, target_lang: str) -> TranslationResult:
    """Translate text between languages.
    
    Args:
        text: The text to translate
        source_lang: Source language code (e.g., 'en')
        target_lang: Target language code (e.g., 'ur')
        
    Returns:
        TranslationResult containing translated text and metadata
        
    Raises:
        TranslationError: If translation fails
    """
```

2. **TypeScript/JavaScript** - Use JSDoc:
```typescript
/**
 * Analyze speech audio for pronunciation scoring
 * @param audioBuffer - The audio data to analyze
 * @param language - Target language for analysis
 * @param referenceText - Expected text content
 * @returns Promise resolving to pronunciation analysis
 */
async function analyzePronunciation(
  audioBuffer: ArrayBuffer,
  language: string,
  referenceText: string
): Promise<PronunciationAnalysis>
```

### API Documentation

- Use OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
- Include request/response examples
- Document error codes and messages
- Provide usage examples

### User Documentation

- Keep README.md up to date
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Create tutorials for new features
- Update troubleshooting guides

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### Python Style

We use:
- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

```bash
# Format code
black .
isort .

# Lint code
flake8 .
mypy .
```

Configuration in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 100
target-version = ['py311']

[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
line_length = 100

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.11"
strict = true
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Style

We use:
- **ESLint** for linting
- **Prettier** for formatting
- **TypeScript** for type safety

```bash
# Lint and format
npm run lint
npm run format

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

### General Guidelines

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use descriptive, meaningful names
   - PascalCase for classes and types
   - camelCase for functions and variables
   - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
   - kebab-case for file names

2. **File Organization**
   - Group related functionality
   - Keep files focused and small (< 300 lines)
   - Use index files for clean imports

3. **Error Handling**
   - Use typed exceptions in Python
   - Proper error boundaries in React
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Log errors with context

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Component Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
2. **Dependency Injection**: Use DI for testability
3. **Interface Segregation**: Define minimal, focused interfaces

   - Batch processing where beneficial
   - Proper resource cleanup
   - Memory management for large models

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Code Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement rate limiting

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
