**Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered FSI Language Instructor Training Platform**

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered eLearning platform aimed at training language instructors. The primary goal of this platform is to ensure that instructors meet the professional needs of students at the U.S. Embassy Islamabad, enabling them to effectively interact with both the Urdu-speaking public and English-speaking staff. The training provided to instructors via this platform must be **in strict accordance with the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) Language Skill Descriptions** for both Urdu and English language proficiency, as detailed in the Statement of Work (SOW).

**2. Stakeholders & Users**
*   **Primary Users**: Language instructors (Urdu and English).
*   **Secondary Users**: U.S. Embassy personnel responsible for overseeing language programs, such as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and HR Office.
*   **Beneficiaries**: U.S. Embassy students (non-Urdu speaking personnel and non-English speaking personnel).

**3. Goals & Objectives**
The platform will enable the U.S. Embassy to:
*   Ensure language instructors are **highly proficient and culturally competent** in teaching methodologies aligned with FSI standards.
*   **Standardise the quality of language instruction** for both Urdu and English across all proficiency levels (survival, beginner, intermediate, advanced, specialized short courses, guided study, language coaching, section-specific training).
*   Facilitate instructors in **developing and implementing curricula** that meet student's professional needs, including job-related language terminology.
*   Support instructors in **accurate and consistent student assessment** and progress reporting based on FSI descriptions.
*   Streamline the process of **onboarding and continuous professional development** for language instructors.

**4. Core Functionality (AI-Powered Training Modules for Instructors)**

The platform will provide AI-driven modules to train instructors on the following key areas:

**4.1. FSI Language Skill Standardisation & Application**
*   **Interactive FSI Proficiency Guides**:
    *   **Detailed breakdowns of FSI Speaking levels (S0-S5)**: Modules explaining the characteristics of each level, including oral production, vocabulary, structural accuracy, time concepts, pronunciation, stress, and intonation, with AI-generated examples and non-examples.
    *   **Detailed breakdowns of FSI Reading levels (R0-R5)**: Modules explaining comprehension abilities, recognition of language elements, handling of connected prose, and understanding of nuance and complexity at each level, with AI-generated text samples for practice.
    *   **Cross-language FSI application**: Training on how FSI standards apply to both Urdu and English instruction, highlighting language-specific considerations.
*   **AI-Simulated Student Interactions**:
    *   **Role-playing scenarios**: AI-driven simulations where instructors practice evaluating student spoken language against FSI speaking benchmarks (e.g., identifying if a student's speech aligns with S1 or S2 characteristics).
    *   **AI-generated written responses**: Instructors practice assessing written student work against FSI reading benchmarks (e.g., evaluating if comprehension aligns with R1 or R2).
    *   **Adaptive Feedback**: AI provides immediate, personalised feedback on instructor assessments, pointing out discrepancies with FSI criteria and suggesting areas for improvement in their evaluation skills.
*   **Teaching Strategies for FSI Progression**:
    *   **Curriculum Development Tools**: AI-assisted tools for instructors to design course curricula that progressively advance students through FSI levels. This includes generating content ideas for **standard survival, beginner, intermediate, and advanced language training**, as well as **specialized short courses**.
    *   **Integration of Job-Related Language**: AI support to help instructors identify and integrate job-related language terminology and usage pertinent to students' specific job requirements within the U.S. Embassy (e.g., Consular, Facilities).
    *   **Adaptive Instructional Design**: AI suggests instructional goals and methods based on FSI standards and helps instructors prepare and develop appropriate training materials and teaching aids.

**4.2. Instructor Responsibilities & Best Practices**
*   **Assessment and Reporting Training**:
    *   **Test Development & Administration**: Modules on developing and transparently implementing initial and periodic language proficiency tests that align with the contractor's developed test and FSI goals.
    *   **Progress Documentation**: Training on how to document student progress, measure performance under each lesson module, and prepare training recommendations.
    *   **Report Generation**: AI-assisted templates and guidance for instructors to draft required reports, including initial enrollment reports, final course completion reports, ad hoc reports (e.g., program improvement, lessons learned), and performance-related feedback for students.
*   **Student Counseling Skills**:
    *   **Simulated Counseling Sessions**: AI-powered simulations for instructors to practice counselling students on performance, discussing corrective actions, and making specific recommendations for remedial or supplementary training.
    *   **"Students in danger of failing" protocol**: Specific AI-driven training for counselling students who are at risk of failing proficiency tests, resulting in specific, documented tasks.
*   **Cultural Competence & Inclusivity**:
    *   **Inclusive Curriculum Design**: Modules on ensuring curriculum is inclusive, reflects diverse perspectives and cultures, and provides equitable access to resources.
    *   **Accessibility Training**: Training on ensuring instructional materials and delivery methods are accessible to students with disabilities.
    *   **EEO Principles**: Modules reinforcing Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) principles in all program activities, including vacancy announcements for instructors.
*   **Technology Proficiency**:
    *   **Online Platform Usage**: Training modules on effectively utilising virtual platforms for online classes (TEAMS, Google Meet, Zoom, Skype, etc.).
    *   **Software Proficiency**: Training on using MS Office and language-related software packages like "In page".
*   **Resource Library Management**: Training for instructors on establishing and maintaining a comprehensive, accessible, regularly updated, and logically organised resource library with diverse multilingual resources.

**5. Technical Requirements**

*   **AI/Machine Learning (ML) Capabilities**:
    *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For detailed analysis of spoken and written language, enabling the AI to understand and evaluate language proficiency against FSI criteria in simulated environments.
    *   **Generative AI**: For creating diverse simulated student responses and dynamic training scenarios.
    *   **Predictive Analytics**: To identify instructor training needs and suggest personalised learning paths based on performance data.
